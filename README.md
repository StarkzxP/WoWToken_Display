## Description

It's a small addon that adds a button to the minimap, displaying the current WoW Token price. It's designed for players who want to have the token price easily accessible while keeping the WoW interface as close to vanilla as possible, without using many addons.

### Do you use ElvUI, TitanPanel or Bazooka?

Maybe my other addon, [WoW Token Price LDB](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wow-token-price-ldb), might suit you better.
